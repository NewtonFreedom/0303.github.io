<h1>Opportunities</h1>


</ul><p align="justify"> <b>Efficiency and safety:<b><p/>
	<p align="justify"> As robotics and AI technology is developed, the amount of tasks that require an astronauts with boots on the ground will be further and further diminished. 
		This will greatly reduce risk to human life and wellbeing in space as humanity ventures outward, mitigating the need to expose our relatively fragile bodies to hazardous alien conditions.<p>
	<p align="justify"> <b>Saving lives on Earth:<b><p/>	
	<p align="justify"> Development of these technologies will likely transfer over to robots designed to operate in hostile conditions on Earth, such as searching for survivors after a disaster or navigating an active minefield. <p>
